Simple program muting audio while spotify is running ads
It's getting the current windows title and if it's not corresponding to music, sound is muted.
Tips : create an alias like this one so you just have to use the command spotify and enjoy ```alias spotify="spotify & python3 /PATH_TO_SCRIPT/spotify.py;"```
